        <p>The Anonymous Hope is a non-profit organization based out of Mumbai. Founded in 1959, Anonymous Hope works
          extensively to reach and rehabilitate People with Disability (PwD) from the most underprivileged segments
          (economically marginalised and deprived communities) of society. Our aim is to create an inclusive society
          where people with disabilities are accepted into mainstream society - a culture and ecosystem where they can
          earn, live and sustain with dignity and respect. We have been awarded for our work in the field of disability.
          We are also a recognized training institute in the field of disability by The Rehabilitation Council of India
          (RCI).</p>
